The research paper discusses the use of machine learning for malware detection, specifically focusing on embedded stealthy malware. The paper highlights the limitations of traditional ML models in accurately detecting embedded malware due to the dense distribution of malware and benign applications features. To address this challenge, the paper proposes a machine learning-based approach called StealthMiner for hardware-assisted stealthy malware detection.

The proposed approach involves collecting high-performance counter (HPC) features using Perf tool, which provides generalized abstractions over hardware-specific capabilities. The collected data includes HPC traces of branch instructions for both benign and malware applications. The paper emphasizes the importance of feature reduction to minimize computational complexity and overhead. Correlation Attribute Evaluation and Principle Component Analysis (PCA) are used to identify the most significant HPC events, and a subset of 4 HPCs (branch instructions, cache misses, cache references, and branch misses) is selected to represent the behavior of malware.

The proposed time-series-based detection approach, StealthMiner, utilizes the selected HPC features, particularly branch instructions, to detect embedded malware inside benign applications. The paper claims that StealthMiner achieves high detection accuracy for embedded malware. Branch instructions are considered important as most malware rely on branching operations for executing malicious activities.

In this research paper, the authors propose a malware detection model based on distance metric learning. The goal of distance metric learning is to find the most appropriate distance metric parameters to improve similarity-based models, such as k-Nearest Neighbors or k-Means. The paper focuses on two tasks: classifying malware and benign files with minimal error rate, and detecting as much malware as possible while maintaining a low false positive rate.

The proposed detection system processes data from portable executable (PE) file format, specifically the metadata contained in the headers of executable files. The training samples are used to train the distance metric, and then the same samples are used in a KNN classifier with the already learned distance metric to classify testing samples.

The authors compare the performance of their approach with three state-of-the-art distance metric learning techniques. They find that metrics trained in this way lead to significant improvements in the KNN classification.

The paper also addresses the problem of minimizing false positives in malware detection. To penalize false positives, the authors propose an optimization criterion based on an error rate and modify the large margin nearest neighbor (LMNN) method.

Experimental results show that the malware detection system based on distance metric learning achieves an error rate of 1.09% at a false positive rate of 0.74%. It outperforms all other machine learning algorithms considered in the experiment. The authors also achieved an error rate of 1.15% at a false positive rate of 0.13% when considering the minimal false positive rate.
